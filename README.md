# Hello and welcome to my capstone project
This capstone project is part of my Java fullstack bootcamp at neuefische GmbH.
As I develop this app in the coming weeks, which has no name at the moment, I will update this readme as I make progress in my code.

## About this project
Do you know these moments? When again, some social media grabs your attention, you scroll through the feed and you see clips or quotes from a podcast and you are thinking "Dang, this sounds so interesting, I really would like to know more about it, but I just don't have the time to listen to an hour long podcast."

Do you share this almost antagonizing sensation with me?

I at least have it, that I see many podcasts, where I would really like to know what interesting points they make, what grain of wisdom I am missing out on and which news I don't get to hear, which potentially could really benefit me. I guess that pretty much sums up my **FOMO**.

I wanted to do something about it and that is what my project is about. This app is going to transcribe any podcast that you want and even summarizes it for you.
With this app, you will be able to access the information from a podcast whenever you want, without going through hours of listening. You will be able to retrieve the condensed information in seconds and if you desire, you can dig deep and read what was said sentence by sentence.

Stay tuned, I will update my progress!


All the best,
Tom
